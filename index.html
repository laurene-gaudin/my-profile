I love writting and that's why I publish twice a month an article in the media <i> Major-Prépa </i>.

			<h2>My academic background 📖</h2>
				<p>
				After three years of preparation to competitive entrance exam to graduate school in Versailles, I entered Audencia Business School in Nantes in September 2019. I am in English track, which means all my classes are taught in English, and I took Digital Culture as an option.

			<h2>My skills</h2>
				<p>
				I have always been fond of learning new languages. Even if I was born and raised in Paris, my mother is Spanish so I have always spoken Spanish at home. That's the reason why I decided to learn German with 12 years old, and as I loved this language, I spent three months in Germany, near Ulm when I was 14 years old so that I could learn it faster. I have studied English and, as it is written above, all my classes are in English in Audencia. I got 930 out of 990 in my TOEIC exam. 
				I also started to learn Italian in September 2019.

			<h2>My hobbys</h2>
				<p>
				I am very keen on theater and I had the chance to have a supporting role in a short serie directed by Laurent Four in 2011 🎬. I joined in 2015 the Conservatoire Régional of Fresnes to have a classical background. I loved playing Roxane in Cyrano de Bergerac, and rewriting the theatre play <i> God </i> from Woody Allen.
				I love going to concerts and festivals 🎪 (Solidays 🏳️‍🌈, We Love Green 🥗).
				I also enjoy taking pictures 📸.
